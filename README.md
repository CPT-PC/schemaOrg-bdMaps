# Motivations

The first aim was expressed as SchemaOrg's [issue-280](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/280), *"Schema.org should have mappings to Wikidata terms where possible"* ([Dan Brickley](https://github.com/danbri) - coordinator)... But, the goal changed from "map SchemaOrg to Wikidata" to "map Wikidata to SchemaOrg"... And, after 2 years and some work, we (a little group of voluntaries) noticed again that we need the initial goal.

In this project we want to join the two sides of the bridge!

Wikidata and SchemaOrg also represents two choices of concept-semantic definition strategies, [extensional and intensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_and_intensional_definitions):

* *SchemaOrg definition strategy* is simple and pragmatic. All entries (classes and properties) define intention in a short  phrase, and the real concept is building by community, with extension at initial samples or statistics of use.

* *Wikidata definition strategy* is based on Wikipedia. All entries (mainly classes) define intention associating item with corresponding Wikipedia's entry.

So, providing SchemaOrg-side we enhance correct use and avoid confusion for SchemaOrg users.  Providing wikidata-side we enhance Wikidata definition and offer access to Wikidata users the biggest semantic sampler of the Web.

## Working on SchemaOrg side
... to-do list:

* To establish a convention (methodology) for inclusion of the definitional Wikidata-link in the RDF SchemaOrg item.
* To include (where possible), in the "core SchemaOrg", the links
